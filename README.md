This version of Nomic for Obsidian is taken from the Nomic Initial Set by Professor Peter Suber. It has been formatted and optimized for use in an Obsidian vault. The original post from Peter Suber can be found via the following citation:

>Suber, Peter. ‚ÄúNomic: A Game of Self-Amendment.‚Äù Last updated in 2003. [website here](https://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/nomic.htm)


## üèÅ Where to begin
If this is your first time investigating Nomic, consider briefly skimming the [Wikipedia article](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Nomic) on the game.

After finding a group of friends to play with, make sure that everyone has read through the [[001 Initial Set|initial set]] a couple of times to become familiar with the rules of the game. It may be instructive for new (and seasoned) players to (re)read the [[002 Introduction|introduction]] to the game to better understand the philosophy of *Nomic.*

## üìù How to use this vault
### ‚Ä£ Game Logistics
The actual move-by-move *discussion* that is such an essential part of *Nomic* is something that should likely take place outside this Obsidian vault. Whether playing in-person or via the internet, it is likely that player discussion would be best suited to verbal conversation, a text or voice call platform (such as Discord), or some other method of speedy user-identified interaction.

This repo was designed so that players could easlily maintain an accessible, hyperlinked database with descriptions of the rules that are currently enacted at any given stage of a *Nomic* game. In this way, Obsidian can act as an easily-referenced and cross-referenced community Wiki for your *Nomic* game.

Depending on your philosophy in playing *Nomic,* you may choose to expand this vault. Some players may wish to add directories for recording [[212|judgments ]] or for keeping a running commentary on votes, discussions of rule proposals, etc. Alternatively, players may wish to add additional tags, metadata, or even notes for definitions of terms. As the fun of *Nomic* is the exploration of interpretation, these tasks have been left for the users of the vault to undertake.
### ‚Ä£ New Rules
New notes can be created with the shortcut **\[CMD\] + \[N\].** New notes (rules) are automatically added to the folder, "300 New Rules." This configuration can be changed in the settings. After creating a new note for a rule, you can automatically insert the packaged rule template using the shortcut **\[CMD\] + \[Y\].**
### ‚Ä£ YAML Frontmatter
When using the new rule template, [YAML Frontmatter](https://help.obsidian.md/Advanced+topics/YAML+front+matter) will be automatically added to your new rule. The frontmatter fields are intended to be used to track:
1. who has proposed the rule (```proposed_by:```)
2. what turn the rule was proposed on (```turn:```)
3. how many points may have been awarded (```points:```)

Because the nature of *Nomic* is that the game continually changes, you may wish to edit the [[011 Rule Template]] file to reflect whatever YAML metadata will be most useful as the game progresses.

### üîç Using Dataview

This vault is best used with the [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugin installed so that lists of rules and players can be automatically tabulated from YAML frontmatter on the following pages:
- [[003 Immutable Rules]]
- [[004 Mutable Rules]]
- [[005 Active Rules]]
- [[006 Inactive Rules]]
- [[007 Players]]

## üìÅ Hosting this vault

Players of Nomic may wish to host this vault in a shared directory through the use of any of the following means:
- a directory in a network drive
- a cloud hosting service such as Google Drive, OneDrive, iCloud, etc.
- a dedicated repository on Github (especially if version tracking and the ability to revert changes is important)
	- If you use Github for this purpose, you may wish to install the *[Obsidian Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git)* plugin

In this way, a shared copy of the rules in effect and any other important information for the game can be synchronized between players in a relatively easy manner.
